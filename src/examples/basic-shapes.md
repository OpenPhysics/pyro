# Basic Shapes

A minimal introduction to VPython's 3D primitives. This example creates a static scene with five fundamental shapes, each positioned and colored distinctly.

## What You'll See

- **Sphere** — Red sphere at the origin (radius 1)
- **Box** — Blue cube offset along the x-axis
- **Cylinder** — Green cylinder along the y-axis
- **Cone** — Yellow cone pointing downward
- **Arrow** — Cyan arrow indicating direction

## Concepts Demonstrated

- `sphere(pos, radius, color)` — Position, size, and color
- `box(pos, size, color)` — Rectangular solids
- `cylinder(pos, axis, radius, color)` — Cylindrical geometry
- `cone(pos, axis, radius, color)` — Conical geometry
- `arrow(pos, axis, color)` — Directional vectors

## Tips

- Drag to rotate the view and explore the scene from different angles
- Use scroll to zoom in and out
- Great starting point for understanding VPython's coordinate system and shape API
